# GroceryListPredictor (WIP)

This is the repository of the project from the team "Die KIndsk√∂pfe" for the <a href="https://bw-ki.de/app/entry-page">german national artificial intelligence contest BwKI</a>.

It uses AI concepts from across the board including NLP, image computing and reinforcement learning, to implement a recommendation system for predicting grocery shopping lists by analyzing your shopping behaviour.

Included in this repository is a webapp for easy usage of the prediction model and a bunch of notebooks explaining each part of the model.

The documentation can be found <a href="https://luanademi.github.io/GroceryListPredictor/">here</a>.
